We have divided Finland into four geographical zones (Northwest, Northeast, Southwest, Southeast) according the approximate center point of the Finnish mainland located at `26.3, 64.5` (longitude, latitude in decimal degrees).\n\n![FMI stations](img/FMI_stations_70_years_older.png)\n\n[1]: The locations and the age of weather stations were obtained from: http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/observation-stations\n\nBelow, we have given you the coordinates of 34 weather stations.\nThe location of a single station is determined with a pair of latitude and longitude coordinates.\nThe coordinates of all the stations are separated into two lists (`lat` and `lon`) and the names of the stations are in the `stations` list. From these lists, you would get, for example, the location of the first station by combining the latitude and longitude coordinates from the coordinate lists, and the name of that station from the `stations` list at index `0`.\n\n### Problem statement\n\nIn this problem your task is to print the names of weather stations located in different zones. **Optionally**, you can also report the share of weather stations that allocated to each zone that could be used to evaluate if certain zone was over/under-represented 70 years ago. This optional task does not affect your score on this problem.\n\nTo solve this problem, you should modify and fill in the missing parts in the code cells below.\n\n### Tips for completing this problem\n\n- Use **exactly** the same variable names as in the instructions because your answers will be automatically graded, and the tests that grade your answers rely on following the same formatting or variable naming as in the instructions.\n- **Please don't change the file names**. Do all of your editing in the provided `Exercise-3-problem-1.ipynb` file (this file).\n\n### Scores for this problem\n\n**Your score on this problem will be based on following criteria:**\n\n- Creating four lists for geographical zones in Finland (i.e. `nort_west`, `north_east`, `south_west`, `south_east`)\n- Iterating over the values and determining to which geographical zone the station belongs\n    - Hint: You should create a loop that iterates `n` times. Create a variable *`n`* that should contain the number of stations we have here.\n    - You should use a conditional statement to find out if the latitude coordinate of a station is either North or South of the center point of Finland (`26.3, 64.5`) **AND** if the longitude location is West or East of that center point.\n    - You should insert the name of the station into the correct geographical zone list\n- Printing out the names of stations in each geographical zone","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"nbgrader":{"cell_type":"markdown","checksum":"2d39627dbc46abfbfe9e4c09caa420a6","grade":false,"grade_id":"cell-5c68af490e1d2129","locked":true,"schema_version":3,"solution":false},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## The data\n\nHere, we provide the data you should use to solve Problem 3 (run the cell to store values in memory.","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"nbgrader":{"cell_type":"markdown","checksum":"1e1beeac7e3d0fbe4f8775987eed7c2e","grade":false,"grade_id":"cell-5c0a48bd858489b8","locked":true,"schema_version":3,"solution":false}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Station names\nstations = ['Hanko Russarö', 'Heinola Asemantaus', 'Helsinki Kaisaniemi', \n            'Helsinki Malmi airfield', 'Hyvinkää Hyvinkäänkylä', 'Joutsa Savenaho', \n            'Juuka Niemelä', 'Jyväskylä airport', 'Kaarina Yltöinen', 'Kauhava airfield', \n            'Kemi Kemi-Tornio airport', 'Kotka Rankki', 'Kouvola Anjala', \n            'Kouvola Utti airport', 'Kuopio Maaninka', 'Kuusamo airport', \n            'Lieksa Lampela', 'Mustasaari Valassaaret', 'Parainen Utö', 'Pori airport', \n            'Rovaniemi Apukka', 'Salo Kärkkä', 'Savonlinna Punkaharju Laukansaari', \n            'Seinäjoki Pelmaa', 'Siikajoki Ruukki', 'Siilinjärvi Kuopio airport', \n            'Tohmajärvi Kemie', 'Utsjoki Nuorgam', 'Vaala Pelso', 'Vaasa airport', \n            'Vesanto Sonkari', 'Vieremä Kaarakkala', 'Vihti Maasoja', 'Ylitornio Meltosjärvi']\n\n# Latitude coordinates of Weather stations  \nlats = [59.77, 61.2, 60.18, 60.25, 60.6, 61.88, 63.23, 62.4,\n       60.39, 63.12, 65.78, 60.38, 60.7, 60.9, 63.14, 65.99,\n       63.32, 63.44, 59.78, 61.47, 66.58, 60.37, 61.8, 62.94,\n       64.68, 63.01, 62.24, 70.08, 64.501, 63.06, 62.92, 63.84,\n       60.42, 66.53]\n\n# Longitude coordinates of Weather stations \nlons = [22.95, 26.05, 24.94, 25.05, 24.8, 26.09, 29.23, 25.67, \n       22.55, 23.04, 24.58, 26.96, 26.81, 26.95, 27.31, 29.23, \n       30.05, 21.07, 21.37, 21.79, 26.01, 23.11, 29.32, 22.49, \n       25.09, 27.8, 30.35, 27.9, 26.42, 21.75, 26.42, 27.22, \n       24.4, 24.65]\n\n# Cutoff values that correspond to the centroid of Finnish mainland\n# North - South\nnorth_south_cutoff = 64.5\n\n# East-West\neast_west_cutoff = 26.3","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"nbgrader":{"cell_type":"code","checksum":"dbe4140e5913699f7487be22e490b39f","grade":false,"grade_id":"cell-888d0ee752aed9d0","locked":true,"schema_version":3,"solution":false},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Part 1 (0.5 points)\n\n- Create four empty lists for the geographical zones in Finland.
