Do all of your editing in the provided `Exercise-3-problem-1.ipynb` file (this file).\n\n### Scores for this problem\n\n**Your score on this problem will be based on following criteria:**\n\n - Using a for loop to iterate over the temperature values\n - Using conditional statements to find out if a value is within certain value range (class)\n - Printing information for the user\n - Including comments that explain what most lines in the code do\n - Uploading your notebook to your GitHub repository for this week's exercise","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"nbgrader":{"cell_type":"markdown","checksum":"ff6fb57faa2f7150f8e4f23ca05c39d6","grade":false,"grade_id":"cell-c0c00a79becb8149","locked":true,"schema_version":3,"solution":false,"task":false},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data description\n\nThe data for this problem comprise a list of night-time, daytime and evening temperatures for April 2013 recorded at the Helsinki Malmi Airport.
